# Timeline Control

Sample code for the video Timelin Control.

# Obtaining the Source

Use git to clone this repository, then update the vcpkg submodule to bootstrap
the dependency process.

```
git clone https://github.com/LegalizeAdulthood/timeline-control
cd timeline-control
git submodule init
git submodule update --depth 1
```

# Building

A CMake preset has been provided to perform the usual CMake steps of
configure, build and test.

```
cmake --workflow --preset default
```

Places the build outputs in a sibling directory of the source code directory, e.g. up
and outside of the source directory.

# Display Snapshots

Open a JSON fixture through File > Open in `timeline-viewer`, then use
File > Export Snapshot to save the displayed timeline as text. The export
includes the current viewport, selection, and playhead geometry, but not
the viewer's metadata or inspector panels.

`timeline::render_snapshot` in `timeline/Snapshot.h` renders the same
display list without toolkit dependencies. Each line records a primitive
kind, semantic style role, quoted lane and item IDs, and integral geometry.
Text includes its quoted value; polylines include a point count followed
by coordinate pairs. Strings escape quotes, backslashes, control bytes,
and non-ASCII bytes. Output uses locale-independent numbers and LF line
separators.

Golden snapshots under `tests/test-timeline-paranimator/fixtures/snapshots`
exercise the existing empty, event, RMS curve, and keyframe JSON fixtures
at fixed viewport dimensions and layout metrics. Viewer exports reflect
native metrics and interaction state, so compare their visible structure
rather than expecting identical coordinates.
